# Quora Insincere Questions

Repository to predict whether a question asked on Quora is sincere or not.

An insincere question is defined as a question intended to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers. As per the challenge details - *"A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions -- those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers."*

I haven't added the training data to this repository (training data along with the word vectors add up to ~6GB). 
You can find [the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data) here.
